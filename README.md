CS 310 Midterm Exam
===================
This exam is worth 15 points and has 5 "questions", each represented by a unit
test. The first 3 questions have their unit tests fully specified, and you must
implement the Hangman class methods to ensure that those tests pass correctly.
The final 2 questions only have meaningful unit test names. You must create the
unit tests to satisfy the names and then implement the Hangman class methods
so that those tests pass correctly.
